	\begin{abstract}
		This technical report presents a Branch-and-Price algorithm aiming to solve the Bin-Packing problem. For this algorithm, two different branching rules and three different exploration methods are implemented. A dynamic programming method able to solve the subproblems dynamically instead of using a classical LP solver is also provided. Furthermore, 
		heuristics which can tighten upper and lower bounds can be proceeded before and during the branching tree exploration . In the first section, the mathematical background of a Branch and Price method suited for the Bin-Packing problem is presented. In the second section, the main structure of the  algorithm is exposed with some details about its simplest parts. The third section presents the node processing method for the Ryan \& Foster and the Generic branching scheme. Then, the heuristics implemented are detailed. Some other method not yet implemented but which could have improve the algorithm are presented in the fifth section. Finally, some details about the implementation and the computational results are given in the last section.
