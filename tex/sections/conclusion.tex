In this report, we try to solve the Bin Packing problem with a Branch and Price approach. We have seen that this is relevant as this problem has an easy and a hard constraint. These constraints can be handled using a column generation approach, by using patterns instead of raw items and by restricting the problem to a subset of the possible patterns. We also saw that the problem can be continuously relaxed in order to be solved quickly but we have to introduce branching rules to get the integer optimal solution. For theses branching rules, two methods were treated : Ryan \& Foster method and a more generic branching method. The first method allows to keep only one subproblem per node of the enumeration tree and it can be solved with Gurobi. The seconds methods preserve some particular properties but several subproblem have to be solved. The conservation of these particular properties allows to solve the subproblems either with Gurobi or using a dynamic programming algorithm. We have also presented different queueing methods to explore the branching tree and different ways to get upper bounds at the root or within the tree. Results are quite good for small instances but the algorithms struggles a bit when there are too many items. Some amelioration can still be implemented to improve the algorithm such as diving heuristics or a dynamic programming resolution for the Ryan \& Foster method.
