\subsection{Branch-and-Price approach }

To address the NP-hardness of the problem, we can solve this problem with a Branch-and-Price algorithm.

\subsubsection{Set covering formulation}

We choose an other formulation of the \eqref{BPP-classic}. Let $\Pc$ the set of all combination of items of $I$ such that their cumulative size doesn't exceed the bin capacity $C$. Each element of $\Pc$ is called a pattern. Let $P=|\Pc|$, we have
\begin{equation*}
	\Pc = \bigg \{ \x \in \{0,1\}^{|N|}, \quad \sum_{i=1}^N x_i s_i \leq C \bigg \} = \bigg \{ \x = \sum_{p=1}^P \alpha^p \bar{x}^p, \quad \sum_{p=1}^P \alpha^p = 1, \alpha \in \{0,1\}^{|P|}  \bigg \}
\end{equation*}
Here, $\bar{x}^p$ is a pattern and $\bar{x}^p_i=1$ if the item $i$ is used in the pattern $p$. Using this Dantzig reformulation of the set $\Pc$, we can write \eqref{BPP-classic} under its set covering formulation :
\begin{equation}
	\label{SCBPP}
		\left \{
		\begin{array}{*5{>{\displaystyle}l}}
		\min & \sum_{p=1}^P \alpha^p \\
		\st & \sum_{p=1}^P x_i^p\alpha^p = 1 & \forall \ i = 1,\dots,N \\
		& \alpha^{p} \in \{0,1\} &  \forall \ p = 1,\dots,P
		\end{array}
		\right.
	\tag{$\Sbb\Cbb\Bbb\Pbb\Pbb$}
\end{equation}
For this formulation, $x_i^p=1$ if the item $i$ is within the pattern $p$ and $\alpha^p=1$ if the pattern $p$ is used in the solution. Thus, the solution is a set of patterns and each patter correspond to a bin. The constraint ensure that each item is packed in a pattern.

On thing to notice is that $|P|$ (the number of variables) is huge. At most, $|P|$ is the number of combination available with $N$ items. Even for small instances, the number of variable is not tractable. Furthermore, it is needed to enumerate and store all the patterns possible in order to solve the problem which could involve a huge amount of memory. 

\subsubsection{Restricted master problem}

To handle this problem, we introduce a new set $\Pc' \subset \Pc$ of cardinal $P'$ containing only a fraction of the available patterns. We can solve \eqref{SCBPP} on this restricted number of pattern, which is more trackable. This leads to a sub-optimal bound. This new problem is called the restricted master problem :
\begin{equation}
	\label{RMBPP}
	\left \{
	\begin{array}{*5{>{\displaystyle}l}}
	\min & \sum_{p=1}^{P'} \alpha^p \\
	\st & \sum_{p=1}^{P'} x_i^p\alpha^p = 1 & \forall \ i = 1,\dots,N \\
	& \sum_{p=1}^{P'} \alpha^p \leq B \\
	& \alpha^{p} \in [0,1] &  \forall \ p = 1,\dots,P'
	\end{array}
	\right.
	\tag{$\Rbb\Mbb\Bbb\Pbb\Pbb$}
\end{equation}
If the set $\Pc'$ is well chosen and contains the optimal patterns, then the optimal solution of \eqref{RMBPP} will be the same as the optimal solution of \eqref{SCBPP} (and also the solution of \eqref{BPP-classic}). The problem is to choose the right patterns to include in $\Pc'$. As $\Pc'$ will also have a big cardinal, we rather solve a relaxation of the master problem and that is why we have that $\alpha_{p} \in [0,1] \ \forall \ p = 1,\dots,P'$. We also add a constraint on the number of pattern allowed as we know that there are only $B$ bins available. If we have some additional informations about the problem, it is possible to tighten this bound. Solving the relaxation will lead to an supra-optimal solution comparing to the integer form of \eqref{RMBPP} (with $ \alpha^{p} \in \{0,1\}$). We will see later how to obtain an integer solution in order to have the same solution as the optimal solution of \eqref{BPP-classic}.

\subsubsection{Subproblem}
\label{subproblem}

We can write an other optimization problem called the subproblem (or pricing problem) which will generate "interesting" patterns to include in \eqref{RMBPP}. If we note $\pi$ and $\sigma$ the optimal dual variables corresponding to the first and second constraint of \eqref{RMBPP}, this pricing problem takes the following form :
\begin{equation}
	\label{SPBPP}
		\left \{
		\begin{array}{*5{>{\displaystyle}l}}
		\min & 1-\sum_{i=1}^{N} \pi_i y_i - \sigma \\
		\st & \sum_{i=1}^{N} y_i s_i \leq C \\
		& y_i \in \{0,1\} &  \forall \ i = 1,\dots,N
		\end{array}
		\right.
	\tag{$\Sbb\Pbb\Bbb\Pbb\Pbb$}
\end{equation}
The solution of the pricing problem is a feasible pattern (\ie which doesn't exceed the bin capacity). The optimal cost is called the reduced cost. We can see that usually, the cost of a pattern is $1$ (one pattern used correspond to one bin used) but here, the cost is penalized by a term containing $\pi$ and $\sigma$. This second term will penalize patterns which can not improve the set $\Pc'$ in the sense that if a pattern $p$ has a high reduced cost, the solution of \eqref{RMBPP} with $\Pc'$ or with $\Pc' \cup p$ will be the same. In fact, if $\opt{z}_{sp}$ denotes the optimal cost and $\opt{\y}$ the associated patter of \eqref{SPBPP} for a given $\pi$ and $\sigma$, then $\opt{\y}$ can improve the solution of \eqref{RMBPP}
if and only if $\opt{z}_{sp}<0$.

On thing very important to notice is that this pricing problem is equivalent to a knapsack problem with weights $\pi$, sizes $s$ and capacity $C$. A knapsack problem is easy to solve. The key mechanism of the Branch-and-Price algorithm will be to solve sequentially \eqref{RMBPP} and \eqref{SPBPP} until a solution $\opt{z_{sp}} \geq 0$ is obtained. At this stage, \eqref{RMBPP} will be solved at optimality. As \eqref{RMBPP} is a relaxation of \eqref{SCBPP}, then we have to introduce a new mechanism in order to obtain feasible solutions.

\subsubsection{Branching}

Now, let's remember that \eqref{RMBPP} is a relaxation of \eqref{SCBPP} so it gives a supra-optimal solution. In order to have the optimal integer solution, we will introduce branching rules (new constraints) to break the fractional property of the variables. Let's consider a tree where each node correspond to a problem with its local branching rules. When a node is solved to optimality (\ie \eqref{RMBPP} is solved sequentially until optimality), we will select fractional variables in the solution to branch on. Then, child nodes will be created under the node just solved with new constraints in order to have a non-fractional variable for the rest of the branch. The tree will be explored node after node until all the nodes are explored. The key idea will be to cut non-improving branches during the explorations so as to explore only a part of the tree.

We can not branch only on the fractional $\alpha^p$. Instead, we will select a pair $(i,j)$ of items such that the variable
\begin{equation*}
	w_{ij} = \sum_{p \in \Pc' | x_i^p=x_j^p=1} \alpha^p
\end{equation*}
is fractional. In one branch, we will impose that $w_{ij} \geq 1$ (items $i$ and $j$ always together) and in the other branch, we will impose that $w_{ij} \leq 0$ (items $i$ and $j$ always separated).
